Linear Regression Model – Student Scores

This project builds a **Linear Regression Model** to predict students’ scores based on study hours.

 Steps Performed
1. Created and loaded dataset (`student_scores.csv`)
2. Visualized Hours vs Scores
3. Split data into Train/Test
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated prediction accuracy
6. Saved trained model

Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

 Files
- `Task3_Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb`
